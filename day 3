# Nmap Network Scanning Practice - Day 3

Today, I practiced various Nmap scanning techniques on the public test server `scanme.nmap.org`.

## Commands I Used:
- `nmap scanme.nmap.org` → Basic scan for open ports.
- `nmap -sS scanme.nmap.org` → SYN (stealth) scan for open ports.
- `nmap -A scanme.nmap.org` → Aggressive scan with OS & service detection.
- `nmap -p- scanme.nmap.org` → Scan all 65,535 ports.

## Learning Outcome:
- Understood the difference between default, stealth, aggressive, and full-port scans.
- Learned why stealth scanning is useful for evading detection.
- Discovered how aggressive scanning can reveal OS, services, and even potential vulnerabilities.

⚠️ All scans were run on `scanme.nmap.org`, which is legally safe for testing.
